            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              At AutismCanRead, we believe every child deserves access to engaging, personalized learning materials that meet them where they are. Our AI-powered platform creates customized reading comprehension worksheets specifically designed for children with autism spectrum disorders and ADHD.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              We understand that traditional one-size-fits-all educational materials often don't work for children with diverse learning needs. That's why we've developed cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology that adapts to each child's unique interests, reading level, and learning style.
