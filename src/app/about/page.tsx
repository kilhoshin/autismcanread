            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              As a parent of a child with autism, I've experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to find learning resources that truly meet our children's unique needs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I often asked myself‚ÄîWhat if I could use my background in AI and software to build something that actually helps?
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              That question led to the creation of ReadersOnTheSpectrum.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              What began as a tool to support my own child's reading journey quickly became something more. I realized that the worksheets generated by this tool‚Äîstructured, personalized, and visually engaging‚Äîwere making a real difference.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I knew I couldn't keep this to myself. I wanted to share it with other parents, educators, and therapists who are walking a similar path.
